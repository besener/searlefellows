The 2025-26 Searle Fellows Program

The Searle Fellows Program is a time-honored Northwestern professional development initiative that recognizes and supports the great promise of early career faculty members who will make significant and long-term contributions to Northwestern University. 

Since 1999, the Searle Fellows Programâ€™s mission has been to cultivate a community of learning & teaching leaders at Northwestern who exemplify excellence and benefit from a shared year-long experience of pedagogical experimentation, critical reflection, and joyful celebration. Over 300 faculty have completed the Searle Fellows Program since its inception. 

Participation in the Searle Fellows Program is often highlighted in promotion and tenure dossiers. Past participants routinely report a positive impact of their participation on the progress of their academic careers.
